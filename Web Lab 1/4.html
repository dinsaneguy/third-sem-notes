    HTML comments are visible to anyone that views the page source code,but are not rendered when the HTML document is rendered by a browser. An HTML comment begins with &lt;!-- and the comment closes with --&gt;.
    <hr>
    Horizontal rules are used to provide a visual break and divide content. We can give horizontal rule in an HTML using &lt;hr&gt; tag.
    <hr>
    Break is used in HTML to insert a single line break.<br> We use &lt;br&gt; tag to force line break in HTML.
